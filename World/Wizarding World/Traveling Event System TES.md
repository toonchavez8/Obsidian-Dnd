# Traveling Event System

## An Introduction

Welcome! This is a guide to use the Traveling Event System. This system was designed not with the goal of achieving realism when roleplaying extended travel, but with the goal of making it exciting. It’s meant to recreate the feel and appeal of other media centered on travel, focusing on dramatic scenarios rather than the real-life mechanics of travel. The Traveling Event System has also been made for those who find things like tracking specific distances depending on pace and other minutiae of other traveling systems tedious. Its design concentrates on keeping those simple and to a minimum.

It is, therefore, not your best option if you’re looking to recreate a realistic travel experience. This guide will not go over how rationing food works or how much ground the party covers when traveling, but rather will give you a way to account for that while prioritizing excitement at the table and a story-first travel design.

You are welcome to add more specifics like food rationing or distance covered, but this guide does not seek to do that, nor has the Travel Event System been designed with that in mind.

## Distance

The Travel Event System (TES for short) measures distance traveled by **Events**. The longer the distance, the more events the party “bumps into.”

Distances are measured in three brackets:

- Close
- Far
- Very Far

We are deliberately not including example distances in these. Close could be 6 miles (10 kilometers) or 18 miles (30 kilometers). It is for the Game Master to decide how much time to spend on each “leg” of the journey. Once you have roughly estimated the distances on your map, you will know exactly how many events the party will run into on their travels.

## Events

Events are the main component of the Traveling Event System. An event is anything that happens while traveling, and the GM decides what events occur. How many events happen on your journey depends on the distance you are traveling:

- **Close**: 1 Event
- **Far**: 2 Events
- **Very Far**: 3 Events

Once a party has encountered the number of events determined by the distance traveled, they arrive at their destination.

> **TIP**: You are welcome and encouraged to alter these numbers. If the distance feels long enough to merit 4 events, tweak it accordingly. Nothing stops you from adding another event to a short distance if the needs of the story dictate it. Rather than getting tangled up in specifics about distance, ask yourself what this journey will feel like. These numbers are just a guide.

## Types of Events

Once you know the number of events, you are ready to choose the events themselves. Events are divided into three main categories and assigned a color that you can place down on your map for quick reference:

### Red - Combat Events

These events are combat scenarios. Since they are deliberately placed, these can be story-relevant combat encounters. Combat events can showcase the monstrous flora and fauna of your world, or be a great way to pick up the pace after a long section of roleplaying.

**Examples**:
- The party has caught the attention of the main antagonist, who challenges them to a “friendly” duel.
- The party meets with rivals, and a fight breaks out after swindling them in a past session.
- A spy has located the party. To prevent the info from reaching the villain, the spy must be dispatched.
- The party ignored markings on trees, warnings of a territorial monster, and must now face the creature.

### Blue - Roleplay Events

These events are roleplay scenarios, where the party interacts with NPCs, which could result in negotiations, alliances, or rivalries. Roleplay events can also bring cultural differences and customs to the forefront, leading to conflicts or alliances.

**Examples**:
- The party meets a rival adventuring group with similar goals, sparking a rivalry.
- A noble invites the party for tea, offering them a deal they cannot refuse.
- The party enters a cursed area, unable to escape without help from ghosts trapped in the land.
- A traveling merchant offers suspiciously low prices, mentioning that the cost is “some gold and a favor.”

### Yellow - Exploration Events

These events focus on the land, showcasing your world. The party must traverse hazardous environments, relying on skills like Survival or Stealth. These events shift the spotlight from combat and social skills to problem-solving and environmental challenges.

**Examples**:
- A rickety bridge stands between the party and their destination, but it looks unstable.
- A magical sea crossing has worn thin, with water jets and lurking monsters threatening the party’s passage.
- A massive dragon turtle stirs, revealing itself to be a moving mountain that the party must escape.
- Crows with human hands steal a prized possession from the party on an old battlefield. The party gives chase.

## Combo Events

Combo Events blend elements from multiple event categories, allowing more complex and dynamic scenarios. These events may start as one type and evolve into another based on party actions.

**Examples**:
- **Purple (Roleplay and Combat)**: The party confronts an evil hag, who offers them a deal. If they refuse, a fight ensues.
- **Green (Exploration and Roleplay)**: A lost kobold could help the party navigate out of a mine if they manage to befriend it.
- **Orange (Combat and Exploration)**: The party must destroy objects binding spirits while enduring ghostly attacks.
- **White (Combat, Roleplay, and Exploration)**: The rival party kidnaps a beloved NPC. The party can negotiate, attack, or sneak into their stronghold.
